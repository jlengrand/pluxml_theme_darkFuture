 This repository contains a simple dark theme for pluxml. 
I created it to my personal website. 

Feel Free to use it if you want, even if it is not finished yet :)

I would also be happy to have some comments ;)


NOTE: The progTips.html file mentionned in info.php is part of another project, called tiddly.
The last version should be retrieved there and uploaded on the FTP separately.

<div name="mondiv1" id="mondiv1">Bloc 1</div>
